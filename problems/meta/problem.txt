Export a function that takes a string argument and returns whether the string
ends with a literal `.` (dot).

Here's a template that you can use:

  module.exports = function (str) {
    /* ... */
  }

`.` is normally a special character in a regexp, but you can refer to a literal
`.` (dot) character by putting a \ (backslash) in front of it.

Whenever you want to refer to a literal one of these characters, you'll need to
put a `\` before the character:

  . * + ? [ ] ( ) ^ $ { } | \
