This time your regex should match only when the given string ends with
"BANANAS".

Here's a template that you can use:

  module.exports = function (str) {
    /* return whether str ends with "BANANAS" */
  }

Use a `$` character to anchor on the end of a piece of text.

Remember from the previous adventure that regexes in javascript are between two
`/` characters and they have a `.test()` method.
