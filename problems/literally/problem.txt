For our first adventure, create a new file that will receive a string as an
argument and should return whether the string contains another string,
"LITERALLY".

Here's a template that you can use:

  module.exports = function (str) {
    /* return whether str contains the string "LITERALLY"
  }

To test for the presence of the string "LITERALLY", you can use a regular
expression! Regular expressions begin with a `/` and end with another `/`:

  /I am a regular expression!/

Everything between the `/` characters is the regular expression.

Regular expressions have a number of methods, but there is a method called
`.test()` that accepts a string as an argument to test against.

Add `.test()` to the end of a regex to run a test on a regex:

  /wow/.test('so amaze wow such doge') // returns true or false
