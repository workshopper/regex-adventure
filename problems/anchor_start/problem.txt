This time your regex should match only when the given string begins with
"LITERALLY".

Here's a template that you can use:

  module.exports = function (str) {
    /* return whether str begins with the string "LITERALLY" */
  }

Use a `^` character to anchor on the beginning of a piece of text.

Remember from the previous adventure that regexes in javascript are between two
`/` characters and they have a `.test()` method.
