Just like before, export a module that searches for `x=` followed by a number
and return the number found after the equal sign.

Unlike before, your solution should only match `x=` when there are no word
characters immediately before `x=` or immediately after the number to the right
of the equal sign.

Here's a template that you can use:

  module.exports = function (str) {
    var m = /...your regex goes here.../.exec(str)
    return m ? m[1] : null
  }

Use `(` and `)` to create a capture group like before.

You can use a special type of anchor, `\b` to match when there is a break in a
word.
